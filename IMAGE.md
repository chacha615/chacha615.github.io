# Open Reel Image

**Browser-based graphic design editor for creators**

A professional-grade image editor built for the web. Create stunning social media graphics, thumbnails, posters, and marketing materials—entirely offline, entirely in your browser.

---

## Vision

Open Reel Image is the image editing companion to Open Reel Video. While the video editor handles motion content, Open Reel Image focuses on **static graphic design**—the posters, thumbnails, social posts, and marketing materials that creators need alongside their videos.

Think **Canva meets Photoshop**, but:
- Runs 100% in the browser (WebAssembly-powered)
- Works completely offline
- No account required
- No watermarks
- Professional export quality

---

## Target Users

| User Type | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **YouTube Creators** | Thumbnails, channel art, end screens |
| **Social Media Managers** | Instagram posts, stories, carousels, Twitter graphics |
| **Small Business Owners** | Marketing materials, promotional graphics, sale banners |
| **Content Creators** | Podcast covers, Twitch overlays, TikTok covers |
| **Students & Educators** | Presentations, infographics, educational materials |
| **Freelancers** | Quick client deliverables without expensive software |

---

## Core Philosophy

### Offline-First
Every feature works without an internet connection. Assets, fonts, templates, and processing all happen locally. Your work stays on your device.

### Performance-Obsessed
WASM-powered image processing means native-speed filters and effects. No waiting for cloud rendering. Real-time preview of every adjustment.

### Creator-Focused
Features designed around what creators actually need—social media templates, one-click background removal, export presets for every platform.

### No Compromises
Professional output quality. No artificial limitations. No "upgrade to export in HD" paywalls.

## Summary

Open Reel Image is a browser-based graphic design editor that gives creators professional tools without the complexity of Photoshop or the limitations of Canva's free tier. By running entirely offline with WASM-powered processing, we offer speed, privacy, and freedom that cloud-based competitors can't match.

The editor focuses on the graphics creators actually need—social media posts, thumbnails, marketing materials—with templates and presets that make professional design accessible to everyone.

**Our promise:** Professional graphic design, free forever, no internet required.
